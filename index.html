    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Inconveniences in watching videos in foreign language is currently addressed by transcripts and subtitles. But these services take your attention away from the video and isnâ€™t helpful to those who are visually impaired. Voicelator is a Chrome extension that utilizes existing Microsoft and Google translation technologies to enhance your foreign video watching experience by translating videos from one language to another in real time, outputting an audible translation over the original video. This allows you to be fully immersed in the video without visual distractions.</p>

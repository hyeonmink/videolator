# voicelator

Overview
-------------
Voicelator allows users to easily watch YouTube videos spoken in any preferred language. It is integrated with pre-existing technology, which means that our code repo here is a Google Chrome extension that can be unpacked. We feature simple UI for easy use for everyone and no visual distractions, allowing users to be fully immersed in the videos they are watching!

Major Technologies
-------------
We used Google's YouTube API to pre-load the transcript / subtitles, which are then sent to the Microsoft's Cognitive Services API to be translated. After getting the translated audio file from the Microsoft's API, we synced the audio file with its corresponding video for a smooth translation experience. After research, we chose these specific technologies for cost and efficiency of our program.
